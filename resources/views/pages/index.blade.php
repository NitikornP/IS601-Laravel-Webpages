                                        <p>Home of the famous floating river market west of Bangkok. Many great rivers converge in this delta, making it a fertile plain for rice growing.
                                                In the Central Plains region, food is mainly hot, salty, sweet and sour. Steamed jasmine rice is served with different types of nam prik (chili dipping sauces) and soups.
                                                Tom yum goong (shrimp soup with lemon grass) is a favorite dish. Prepared dishes usually contain many condiments and dried spices.</p>

                                        <h2>Northern Thailand</h2>
                                        <p>In the North of Thailand, around Chiang Mai, the land is mostly jungle-covered mountains and valleys. Historically this area is the home of the Lanna Thais, whose former capital was Chiang Mai.
                                                In the North, the traditional food is mild or hot, salty and sour, but rarely sweet.
                                                Sticky rice (glutinous) is served with steamed vegetables, nam phrik oong, soups and Northern-style curries are common.
                                                The North is also well-known for naem, a sour sausage made of fermented minced pork, wrapped and steamed in banana leaf.
                                                Food is traditionally eaten at a small table and diners sit on straw mats around the table, eating communally. </p>

                                        <h2>Northeastern Thailand</h2>
                                        <p>Also known as "Isan Region", is a high plateau, with low rainfall and porous soil. The cuisine is simple and is traditionally eaten on a pa kao table made from bamboo or rattan.
                                                Food in the Northeast is hot, salty and sour. Papaya salad (sohm tahm), sour chopped meat salad (koi), and sour minced chicken, beef, or pork salad (larb) are favorites.
                                                Many condiments are used but not many dried spices in this region.
                                                Meals are based on sticky rice and a strong paste called nam phrik pla ra (spicy dipping sauce of fermented fish and chilis) accompanied by raw wild and cultivated vegetables and herbs.</p>

                                        <h2>Southern Thailand</h2>
                                        <p>In the South of Thailand there is an abundance of coconut trees and seafood. Food in the South is renowned for being strong in taste - very hot, salty and sour.
                                                Spicy curries are eaten every day, especially coconut curry and sour curry. Generally Southerners eat more fish than meat, because they reside close to the sea.
                                                The most common dipping sauce or paste is nam phrik kapee (also called nam chuke), eaten with raw vegetables and crispy fried fish.
                                                This dipping sauce is prepared with the best quality shrimp paste (kapee or kuey), fresh chilies (prik kee noo), a bit of palm sugar and fresh lime juice.</p>
